#### Task
**Implement the Car and Track classes and cover them with unit tests, any framework is allowed**

- Car takes the fuel consumption per 100 km as a constructor argument (in [main.py](./main.py) this value is 7 - 7L per 100 km)
- Track takes as the first argument the fuel consumption per 100 km per trailer (15L per 100km), and as the second argument, the number of trailers (for example, 2 trailers). The consumption is directly proportional to the number of trailers.
- Car and Track can be refueled with the `fill_up` method, can drive with the `drive` method, and can show how much fuel is left with the `remaining_fuel` method
- When you run `main.py`, you will see how much fuel Car and Track will use if they drive 500 km

Use the current files, do not change them

**`main.py` and unit tests must run**
